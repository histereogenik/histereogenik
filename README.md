# 🏰 Welcome to My Cyber Keep

## ⚔️ About Me

I am a **Back-End focused Full-Stack Developer** who forges robust, secure and scalable systems using **Python, Django, PostgreSQL and Docker** — and when needed, I also ride to battle on the front-end with **React and TypeScript**.

My work is deeply rooted in **real production systems**: VPS deployments, CI/CD pipelines, authentication, payments, subscriptions, logs, monitoring and security hardening.

- 🛡️ Main focus: Back-end architecture, APIs, data modeling, DevOps & deployment
- 🧭 Also experienced in: React + TypeScript front-ends and system integration
- 🎮 Soulsborne and Monster Hunter games enthusiast
- 🌍 Traveler of both real and virtual worlds
